## How this differs to other awesome-<x> repositories?

Other `awesome-<x>` repositories exist for a long time, including the [OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml-community/awesome-ocaml) one. This awesome repository is temporary whilst OCaml 5 gets off the ground. The idea is it can be used by the community to find unreleased repositories and experiments related to Multicore OCaml in order to learn from them and see how you can help!

Eventually this repository will be superfluous and hopefully the content can go to `awesome-ocaml`.
